	The revealed class exists because it's necessary to 'show' a node
	before applying a transition. When an overlay is opened, it is 
	immediately revealed (display: block) and then asynchronously the 
	opened or closing classes are added.

	Because we don't want to actually show the node before a transition
	or animation is applied, when the node is 
	revealed, it is made display: block but visibility: hidden.
	It is then made visibility: visible when it is opened.
